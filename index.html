            Recently I and some friends have had the IMMENSE PLEASURE of joining this mighty nation. While awaiting to join a town we spent a couple of hours as tourists. We were blown away at the grandeur of the structures and the wide array of building types. We could not be more excited to join.</p>

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Valrean Craftbeer.</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by MALLOW ONESHOE</span></p></div>
            When I first walked into Valrum two things shocked me most. The impressive builds, and the copious amounts of alcohol. I found Russian Vodka just lying around! Russian Vodka that you wont be able to find anymore. I decided to explore some of the homebrewing alcohol scene in Valrum after this. The brews that aren't sold but shared among friends. Wheat Beer is probably the easiest and most accessible of alcohols to make. I found that among groups of friends this one is often drunk. Be it after a baptism or successfully gaining citizenship, Wheat Beer was drunk for all these occassions. <p>Some people are happy leaving it at Wheat Beer, and brewing a handful of bottles in between whatever else they do. But among these homebrewers is another breed, the artisan. These players experiment with recipies and workflows. Aiming for higher quality, more difficult to make drinks. They may dabble in distilling, exotic ingredients, and trying to achieve the highest alcohol content possible. These players also seem the most excited to share their creations. From giving away free bottles of Absinthe to anything being worth celebrating with a drink. They are truly a delight to spend time with.</p><br><p>In light of this I would like to try encourage Valreach's homebrew scene to grow to new heights! How I do this? I am not too sure. Perhaps fortnightly craftbeer meet ups? Brewing competitions? I may not have the answers but I would certainly like to try more homebrewed drinks.</p></div>

            Valriegeschlange ist zie schlange bon Valrieges. Despite this, it is rarely spoken outside of formalities or traditions. This language does have a place in the common speak of our people, not only as a unifying aspect of our culture but as a way to discreetly communicate in the presence of other peoples. As such I have taken it upon myself to create a way of making the language more accessible. I have done this by creating a Valriegeschlange translator. This translator allows users to turn English into Valriegeschlange easily. You can access the translator <a href="https://lingojam.com/ValriegeschlangeTranslator">here.</a></p> <p>This translator does have some gaps and issues however. There are many words missing from Valriegeschlange that exist in English which can lead to some sentences needing to be a mix of both. To help address this I will be spending the next week working on creating a fork of Valriegeschlange that is useable in more situations. I also make a public statement to all citizens of Valreach. If we want our language to not just survive, but thrive, we need to create an Imperial Ministranum of Language. A legal body to oversee and enforce the growth and further use of this language. From transcribing treaties and legal documents to commissioning songs, this ministry could ensure the success of Valriegeschlange. If this sounds interesting to you help make it a reality!</p></div>

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p></div>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">It wasn't a dream </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
